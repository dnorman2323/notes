Self Evaluation

One of my strengths during this internship has been to be proactive with my mentors, managers, and fellow engineers whenever I am having a problem or to track my progress. This is also where one of my weakness has occurred as, sometimes, I ask questions about things that I could easily research myself and waste the time of whoâ€™s help I am seeking. I believe I have slowly become better with this as I have built more confidence in my ability to find a solution myself. Another strength is that I have taken criticism well and have used it to better my skills. I understood from the beginning of this internship that it is an extremely important learning experience and I should be grateful to have the opportunity. I also understood that I knew very little about commercial software development and should listen to the experienced people around me. Another weakness I have noticed is that I become less productive at the end of the day. Even though it is a common occurrence among workers, there are steps I could take to improve my productivity. One thing that has helped with this is that I arrive to work earlier as I have found that I am my most productive earlier in the morning. Overall, during this internship, I have tried to work as hard I can to produce quality code that I am proud of. 


Career Aspirations
If I were to continue my career at Cerner, there are a couple of options I would consider. The first being continuing to work with the team I am currently working with as I have greatly enjoyed my time with them. I was unsure if I would find web development interesting but it has proven to be very intriguing and a valuable skill to learn. The team itself has been very welcoming and helpful so it would be easy to continue working with them. Another option I would consider would be to find a team/position that is more involved with the development of hardware solutions as I have great personal interest in that. Embedded Systems, Networking, anything where I can get some hands on engineering is interesting to me.
