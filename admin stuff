Admin stuff

Firstly, I just wanted to thank you for all the help and guidance throughout the summer. I had a great time working with you and I really learned a lot. I also wanted to ask you something. This September, I am applying to Air Force Officer Training School. It’s been a dream of mine for a long time and it’s quite a extensive application. Part of that application is letters of recommendation. I would be extremely gratefully, if you’re not too busy, to write a short one-page reference letter for me and send it to my recruiter. 

Great! I’ll email you the details, like my recruiters email and the like. 


Resume

- Worked alongside Software Engineers to develop a mobile app smart banner which informed android users using the HealtheLife website that there was a HealtheLife Android App which they could download and use. The banner would link the user to the google play store page of HealtheLife where they could install or open it. The banner was built using Javascript, JQuery, CSS, and HTML. 
- Developed the admin tools to customize the mobile app smart banner. Attributes to customize the mobile app smart banner included a choice to display the Cerner HealtheLife App on the banner or a custom app of the organization’s choice. If the user wanted a custom app, they would have to fill out fields such as title, bundle id, and a custom icon. The admin tool would then use that custom information to edit the smart banner accordingly. 
- Worked on a web development team developing the Cerner solution HealtheLife which included a web-based patient portal for patients to manage their own healthcare including looking at their medical records, messaging and scheduling appointment with their doctor, and taking health-based informative workshops. They also developed the admin tool for the patient portal for healthcare organizations to customize the patient portal for their needs and preferences. 

Proficient in Python, Django, HTML, Subversion, and Unix Shell. Familiar with CSS, Javascript, Agile, and Lean. Atlassian tools including JIRA and Crucible. 


Strengths: 
I love learning which make me adaptable to a variety of environments including team or individual-based work.
 
One of my strengths during this internship has been to be proactive with my mentors, managers, and fellow engineers whenever I am having a problem or to track my progress. 

Another strength is that I have taken criticism well and have used it to better my skills. I understood from the beginning of this internship that it is an extremely important learning experience and I should be grateful to have the opportunity. I also understood that I knew very little about commercial software development and should listen to the experienced people around me. 

Weaknesses:
Procrastination: I am susceptible to procrastination, but have improved by using organizational tools such as planner or google calendar. 

I’ve been known to overly proactive with fellow engineers and managers by seeking help and asking questions that I could have probably researched and learned on my own. 
This is also where one of my weakness has occurred as, sometimes, I ask questions about things that I could easily research myself and waste the time of who’s help I am seeking. I believe I have slowly become better with this as I have built more confidence in my ability to find a solution myself. 


Why do you want to be in the Air Force?

Well sir, there are several reasons. Firstly,there is a long tradition of military service in my family. My dad was a hospital corpsman in the Navy, my grandfather work on KC-135s in the 190th Air Refueling Wing in the Air National Guard. My great-grandfather was in the infantry in the 2nd Marine Divison during WWII and took part in several beach landings in the Pacific. I've had two uncles in the Navy, another uncle was an Army Officer, and a step-brother in the Marine Corps who did a tour in Iraq. So, throughout my life the themes of military service and its benefits have been especially prevalent. Secondly for specifically why I chose the Air Force, I've researched the Air Force and found it to be the most contemporary military branch. I believe this is true for its mission, the technology it uses, and its philosophy. Because of this, I believe the Air Force to be the most active and strongest force of change to global policy in the U.S. Military. Another reason why I chose the Air Force was because of its vast educational opportunities. I love learning and I would take full advantage of any continuing education opportunities presented to me. I also want to test and better myself.

Patriotism, love the country
