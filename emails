Hi Rachel, 

I hope you are having a great summer! In case you don’t remember me, I was in your PCS 120 class in Spring 2015. It was by far one of my favorite classes and it changed how I thought about the world and my educational and professional goals. You wrote a extremely kind and well-written letter of recommendation for me last summer for the Air Force scholarship program, TDSP. Sadly, I can report that I wasn’t selected this time around, however, I am currently in the application process for regular Air Force Officer Training School (OTS). It’s basically the same program as TDSP without the scholarship. I wanted to ask you again if you would be able to submit a letter of recommendation to my recruiter, TSgt. Johnathan Newark. I’ve attached your previous letter and, in my opinion, the only edits that need to be made are replace “TDSP” with “OTS”. The application is due sometime in September, I am unsure of an exact date (such is the government), so I hope that gives you plenty of time. 




Hi Alex,

I hope you are having a great summer! In case you don’t remember me, I was in your AMS 100 class in Fall 2015. It was such a great class that I went on to take AMS 110 this last spring and enjoyed it immensely. I am emailing you to remind you that, in December last year, you kindly agreed to write a letter of recommendation for my application to Air Force Officer Training School. The application is due this September, I am unsure of an exact date (such is the government), but I hope that gives you plenty of time. If you don’t have time or can’t for any reason just let me know. Also, if you have any questions let me know. Thank you again, I really appreciate it and know that it will a big help.
